# Infrastructure

This directory contains infrastructure as code (IaC) configurations for deploying TaskVerse to various cloud platforms.

## Planned Infrastructure

### Docker Compose (Current)
- Local development environment
- Single-machine deployment
- Located in `/docker` directory

### Kubernetes (Planned)
- Production-ready orchestration
- Horizontal scaling capabilities
- Helm charts for easy deployment

### Terraform (Planned)
- Cloud infrastructure provisioning
- Support for AWS, Azure, GCP
- Environment-specific configurations

### CI/CD (Planned)
- GitHub Actions deployment workflows
- Automated testing and deployment
- Multi-environment support (dev, staging, prod)

## Directory Structure (Future)

```

```

## Deployment Options

### Development
Use Docker Compose from the root directory:
```bash
npm run docker:up
```

### Production (Future)
Options will include:
- Kubernetes with Helm
- Cloud-native services (AWS ECS, Azure Container Instances, GCP Cloud Run)
- Serverless deployments

## Contributing

When adding infrastructure configurations:
1. Follow the directory structure above
2. Include environment-specific configurations
3. Add documentation for deployment steps
4. Test configurations before submitting PRs

## Security Considerations

- All secrets should be externalized
- Use least privilege access principles
- Enable encryption in transit and at rest
- Regular security updates and scanning
